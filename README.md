To run the test suite:

`cd contract`
`reach run`

The test suite may be run in either interactive
or non-interactive (single-terminal) modes
based on answers when prompted.
To run in interactive mode,
start the test script in two separate terminals,
one to act as the deployer (Alice)
and one to act as the attachers (Bob).

Copy and paste the contract string from the deployer terminal/instance
to the attacher terminal/instance when prompted.

The screen shot below shows a sample of the non-interactive output:
